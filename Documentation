Work flow- 
A student can register to system or admin/ warden can add students. After register, student can submit out pass. After submit one out pass he cannot submit another out pass. One at a time out pass system. After that warden will get the out pass details, warden can accept or decline. If accept then it will generate a qr code. If declined then no qr code. 
After getting qr code. Student can download that qr code or can show it online also to guards.
Guards will scan the qr code and let them go through gate. If the qr code matches then only it will show accepted. (They can make fake qr code. So we have to match the qr code with the generated qr code.). 
[NB- we have 2 sharing boys hostel (2 hostel), 2 sharing girls hostel (2 hostel), like that we have 4 sharing and 8 sharing hostel. and their hostel wardens are not same. So, only 2 sharing hostel students out pass will get 2 sharing warden, 8 sharing hostel warden will get 8 sharing hostel students out pass only. So warden will not confuse]
Students also can book hostel rooms, 2 seater, 4 seater, and 8 seater. And admin will only manage that.
